               Hello there! I'm a developer who is always itching to learn new things while still never losing sight of the customer and the product.  From a past life, I have several years of software testing and project management experience, and have helped my teammates sustainably ship pretty large-scale features to millions of customers worldwide.

               Being a software engineer isn't just about code. Software is ultimately written by people, for people.  This informs my approach at multiple levels.

               First, I realize that it's all about the customer.  And the customer isn't just the end user; there are always multiple customers.  But let's start with the end user.  I always want to know that everything I'm doing is in some way contributing to value being delivered to the end user.  Is the code I'm writing delivering something the customer actually wants?  Is the meeting I'm in bringing clarity to the team, so we can deliver a coherent product?  Is the email I'm writing one that will help customer-facing teams better support our end users?

               Also, I recognize that we face an uncountable number of unknowns when writing software.  As much as we'd like to have certainty before making big decisions, that's just not reality.  It's an inherently uncertain business on multiple levels, and so I believe in being and doing Agile at a fundamental level.  We have to inspect and adapt, as developing great software is an empirical process.  We're going to learn a lot, and at times, we're going to have to pivot.  Also important to recognize is that we don't have to personally make a mistake to learn from it.  We can learn from each other on multiple levels:  we can learn from our immediate teammates, from sister teams within the organization, and from colleagues in the industry and even in other industries.  We just have to be humble enough to do so.

               Last, but not least, this is a team sport.  Just like in any team sport, we may have different roles on the team, and we may have major disagreements on how best to win, but we all need to perform at a high level and in concert with each other if we're going to bring home the prize.  I've worked with software developers, QA, game designers, artists, UX designers, and more...  so I know that no matter what you call yourself, you probably have strong opinions. So I've long since learned that people have opinions for a reason.  We may disagree.  Hell, we may hold mutually exclusive opinions.  But if you've cared enough to share your opinion with me, you must have a pretty important reason to do so, and I promise you two things: you have my full attention and I am listening to fully understand you.

               I can't remember a time when I wasn't interested in computers.  My semi-formal education in programming was at the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, where I was introduced to mostly web technologies (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, MongoDB, and various JavaScript libraries).  However, I also have written in Java, and have dabbled in Golang, Python, and C.  I have also experimented with Linux as a desktop OS (year of the Linux desktop is still TBD!), and have a personal NAS running a CentOS-based distro.

               To stay sharp and level up as a developer, in addition to working on personal projects, I've been working my way through Robert Martin's <em>Clean Code</em> and the CLRS masterpiece, <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>.  I'm also fairly active on Codewars, as I find there to be a great multitude of interesting problems, and I can try out different languages without having to set up a development environment.

               I have several years of experience each as a software tester and as a project manager.  Regardless of the team I'm on or the product I'm helping to deliver, I always try my best to help my team be the best version of themselves, so we can delight our customers and deliver something we'll be proud of.

               As a tester, my north star was the overall quality of the product.  I worked hand-in-hand with my software engineering teammates to provide comprehensive and timely testing.  This wasn't a relationship where software got "kicked over the fence" to testers; we got to a point where we were building functionality in neat increments, such I could test throughout the sprint.  Of course, ensuring the overall quality of the product is impossible if I only worked with software.  I also worked extensively other disciplines, most notably UX, whom I helped set up and run user testing labs.

               As a project manager, my overarching goal was to help my teammates sustainably ship products and features that would delight our customers.  Yes, these qualifiers are important.  We need to ship sustainably, because we're in it for the long haul, and we can't burn ourselves out.  And we need to delight our customers, or else we're not making the best thing we can possibly make.  One of the most memorable products I helped deliver was a replacement matchmaking system for League of Legends.
